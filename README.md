# Coffee-Product-Sales

## Project Overview

I used a couple small datasets relating to sales data of coffee related items in the middle east to help find the best options of cities to open up a new coffee supplier in.

### Tools
- Excel - Data Familiarization
- MySQL - Data Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
- What is the volume of coffee sales per city?
- What are the cities with the highest revenue?
- What are the most popular selling products?
- What cities have the highest spending customers?
- What cities have the most unique customers?
- Does cost of living impact coffee sales? If so, where?

### My Findings 

#### 1. Pune:
  - Avg rent is relatively low, which affects sales positively
  - Highest total revenue
  - Avg sales per customer are also high

#### 2. Dehli:
  - Highest estimated coffee consumers - 7.7mil
  - Highest total customers - 68mil
  - Avg rent is relatively low, which affects sales positively

#### 3. Jaipur:
  - Highest number of customers
  - Avg rent per customer is very low
  - Avg sales per customer is still pretty good - 11.6k
